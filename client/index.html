            <p>The Game of -Game-</p>
            <p>After some contemplation, I have decided to make a cricket-baseball hybrid. Why? Baseball is too complicated (think of how runners and bases   work + stealing and where plays happen etc), and I couldn't think of a way to add visual elements of cricket to a digital looking panel (without it getting super complicated or something), so I thought I'd combine the two.</p>

            <ol>
            <li><p>Each team has 11 players. One team bats, one team fields.</p></li>
            <br>
            <li><p>There are two bases. Each base has a pitcher/baseman.</p></li>
            <br>
            <li><p>A batter starts on a base, the pitcher on the opposite base then bowls/pitches the ball to the batter.</p></li>
            <br>
            <li><p>A pitcher can either make a throw or miss a throw due to a strikezone, and a batter can hit or not hit a ball. Three strikes and they're out. Four balls/Wild Throws/Misses and the batter gets to walk.</p></li>
            <br>
            <li><p>When a batter hits a ball, they run to the opposing base. The ball can be caught, causing an out, or thrown to the base, causing an out. If the batter makes it, they score a point and get to bat again. There are no foul balls, there are no "home runs".</p></li>
            <br>
            <li><p>Three outs changes the inning. There are 9 innings (18 rounds but teams swapped each round).</p></li>
            <br>
            <li><p>Every six balls that are pitched/bowled by a team, a rotation happens. The pitcher on first goes to the outfield, the pitcher on second goes to the first base, and a player from the outfield goes to the second base.</p></li>
            </ol>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>"What can <em>I</em>  do?"</p>
